# proxer-manga-downloader
An unpublished Firefox Extension. Well, it does what it says. Made this for me, as I was curious if reading manga on an ebook seems like an option. (nope)

## Usage
If installed, two new icons will appear on the readers bar.

**Downloading (recommended)**
- download a .txt file containing all the neccessary data
- running the python script will download everything and combine it into a pdf
(downloading and creating the pdf inside the browser was almost fully working, until cors came and totally annihalated me)

**Printing**
- staightforward
- turned out to be very annoying with modern mangas, which have very unusual page sizes
- depending on browser and page size, output files can turn out being *incredibly* bloated
